# Dogfen Document

Dogfen is a self-contained, self-rendering ~markdown~ HTML document.

It allows us to turn a markdown document into a shareable html page with some basic formatting/syntax highlighting.

To get started <span class="btn w-fit inline-block" onClick=" document.getElementById('editor').classList.toggle('hidden')" >open the editor</span> and start writing!

dogfen is welsh for document.
