# dogfen todo's


## Variants

- [ ] read-only source that doesn't import or use codemirror
  - make source smaller for read-only use-case but require more abstraction at build-time
- [ ] cdn-deps
  - would make `dogfen.js` lighter
  - prevents the use of 'offline' mode unless we also embed the modules themselves
- [ ] add support for emoji's
  - I think it might be possible to piggy back off a presetIcons() implementation and the "marked-emoji parser"

## Branding

- [ ] better logo
- [ ] does the readme or a generic "new" page work better as the landing at `https://dogfen.dayl.in`
